:::


`Viv` is a standalone dependency-free `venv` creator (just needs python + pip).
`Viv` helps you ignore silly things like managing temporary or rarely used virtual environments,
while still unleashing the full power of python scripting with it's entire ecosystem at your disposal.

`Viv`'s uncompromising insistence on portability means that it will always,
only use the standard library and never exceed a single script.
